                All I have to say is wow. What a summer. I have definitely been busy at work.
                Unfortunately, I have not been able to devote as much time as I would like to
                this project, as I have had a number of other things going on. However, I've
                still been able to get a bunch of things accomplished.

                First of all, as this project has grown in size, I have decided to split the
                project into two separate repositories. The first repository is the desktop
                application, which is now called Banbury Cloud. The second repository is the
                relay server, which is called NeuraNet. Beginning with Banbury Cloud, I did
                a lot of work on the UI. It is much more elegant looking, with much less
                wasted space. I have implemented a lot of new features, like
                folders, sorting in the table, being able to have a file open when you click
                on the file name, file tree navigation on the left hand side, and many other
                features. As far as NeuraNet, I did a complete code refactor, so it is now
                written in Rust. The difference in speed is noticeable. On top of that,
                I feel like both repositories have definitely grown in size, so I spent a
                significant amount of time just organizing the code, ensuring separation of
                concerns, etc.

                I have a lot of plans for the future. I have just finished a bunch of other
                obligations and projects, so I will have the ability to work on this much
                more consistently in the future. Right now, users are only able to view files
                in one directory, and I would like to change that. One of the next features
                that I am planning on implementing is a sync feature. I want this app to scan
                the user's entire computer as opposed to just one directory. Additionally, I
                am going to begin working on wake-on-lan as well. Of course, there are a good
                amount of bugs and edge cases, such as viewing/opening a file that is not on
                your local computer. Also, things like confirming that the file has actually
                been deleted, or that a file as successfully been uploaded. Finally, I am
                starting to think it is about time to throw together an iphone app... Anyway,
                thanks for reading and I can't wait to see what the future holds.

                After using the app in production for a little bit, and playing around with how the app
                worked in different devices, a lot of problems came to my attention. First of all, I
                realized how difficult it is to run python code natively in a seamless manner. Basically there
                had to be some fancy way to ensure that a certain python interpreter was on the user's device.
                We could have used a venv, but there are complications with that as well, and I finally decided
                that it would be best to do a complete code refactor, changing all of the python code to typescript.
                This turned out to be a huge success! I am now able to download the app on any device and not have
                to worry about any particular dependencies. Great.

                }}
              >
                I also did some testing of the app on different networks. I realized that port 8000 is not an open
                port on all networks. I did some research and realized that it would be best to switch to port 443.
                This is a standard HTTP port that is open on most networks. This solved my problem when testing the app
                on a completely secure wifi network at a University.

                I am definitely at a crossroads when thinking about what I want to do in the future. I think turning this
                app into a full fledged cloud computing platform could be really beneficial to people. For that reason,
                I think I am going to create some more features that will make cloud storage better. Things like implementing
                folders, search bar, sorting in the table that actually works. On the other hand, there are a lot of cool
                AI features that I have in mind, like implementing something called AI Agents. Not only that, but have these
                AI agents work on all of your online devices at the same time, and have them work together to help solve
                our problems. I think the best way to describe it would be to just implement it. Thanks for reading, stay tuned
                for more updates.

                Recently, I have been working hard to release a desktop application, that will serve
                as a prototype to the overall idea. So far everything has been going smoothly, despite a few bugs.
                A lot of work has gone into the actual user interface, playing around with styling. Additionally,
                there was a lot of work just setting up the app, like configuring everything for deployment. Figuring
                out an app icon. Lots of stuff turned out to work in dev but not a production environment, which took
                several days to fix. Hope you like it.

                Recently, we have made a slight change in what we have been doing in terms of the file sharing.
                Initially, we had an idea that IPFS would really be the backbone of the decentralized file sharing.
                We came across a lot of complications, especially when it came to port forwarding.
                In other words, it was really easy to upload files from IPFS and download them again, but only within your own network.
                Ultimately, we decided to drop the idea of IPFS, for now. Instead, we have decided to implement something called a relay server.
                In other words, this provides a way for us to access files on another device, even if that device is on another network.
                This is a really exciting new direction for us.

              <Typography variant='body1' align='left' marginTop={theme.spacing(1)} gutterBottom sx={{ color: theme.palette.text.primary, }}>
                In recent developments, we have been working on a desktop application that would be running all of the logic necessary
                in order to bring the device online. This can't really happen with a web app, and we apps are not able to access things
                like the files on your computer, especially in the way that we want. Our next announcement will hopefully be the release
                of the desktop app. We are also working hard to make the desktop app open source.

                We have recently released the very first Beta version of
                bcloud. bcloud is a CLI tool for Banbury Cloud.
